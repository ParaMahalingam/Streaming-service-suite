# Streaming Service Suite

Streaming Service Suite is a comprehensive platform designed to streamline the process of discovering and tracking movies and TV shows across various streaming services. With the proliferation of streaming platforms, users often face the challenge of finding where their desired content is available. This project, developed as the final year project, aims to address this issue by providing users with a centralised hub to search for specific titles and instantly identify which streaming services offer them.

*This project was created by [@ParaMahalingam](https://www.github.com/ParaMahalingam) as part of a university assignment.*
